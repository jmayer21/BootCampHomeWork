# Bike Counts

For this skill drill, you will formulate a hypothesis about the number of bikes crossing the Brookyln Bridge using the New York Bike Counts dataset. This dataset shows the number of bikes that crossed each of the bridges during each day. Use this dataset to formulate a hypothesis and then use linear regression to test if your hypothesis was correct. 

## Instructions

1. Formulate a hypothesis about the number of bikes crossing the Brooklyn Bridge using the New York Bike Counts dataset.

2. Use your knowledge of linear regression models to create a hypothesis test to evaluate your null and alternative hypotheses.

3. Look at the reported p-value of your linear regression and determine if there is enough evidence to reject the null hypothesis.

#Hypothesis
#There is a strong correlation between Low Temperature and the number of bikes crossing Brooklyn bridge. 
#The higher the temperature the larger the number of bikes crossing the bridge.

#Analysis
#The hypotheses was tested by using the linear regression model. 
#I determined the correlation between Low Temperature and the number of bikes crossing the Brooklyn Bridge by 
#using the pvalue. The pvalue is 0.010, below the significant level(0.05) which indicates that there is a 
#strong correlation between low temperature and the number of bikes crossing the Brooklyn bridge. 
#My initial hypotheses matches the test result; therefore, I did not reject my hypotheses.
